## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Timetable Generation System is a comprehensive scheduling solution designed to automate and optimize academic timetable creation primarily for computer science engineering colleges. It leverages advanced AI and machine learning techniques to generate conflict-free schedules by considering complex constraints such as faculty availability, subject expertise, room capacities, and institutional guidelines based on NEP 2020.

This system addresses the common challenges of manual scheduling — clashes, overbooking, inefficient resource utilization, and lack of adaptability — by dynamically generating timetables that maximize operational efficiency and faculty workload balance. It offers smart adjustments, real-time updates, detailed analytics, and versatile export options in an interactive, user-friendly interface.
